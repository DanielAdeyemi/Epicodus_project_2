This project conclude my second week at Epicodus as a full-time student. **The goal** of the project is to build an application to suggest user what language he/she needs to consider as starting point in their study. This application asks user series of questions and provides a language suggestion based on the answers. As options for languges:
* C++
* Ruby
* JavaScript
* Go
* Python
* C#
* Rust
* Swift
* and also language of user's choice  
*(Please note, that this is not scientificly-based application and was build only as demonstration of certain skills I obtained in the program. Any suggestions you recieve cannot be used as determination of your future!)*
